        <div class="content">
          <p>I would like to share one of my favorite movie monologues first before I start telling about myself.</p>
          <p class="movie-script">"Crazy, I know, but my parents and I never fight.
            It feels like I exist to make them happy. I do what they want me to.
            They want me to get good grade so I spend all my time inside a library. They have no idea how I feel. They don't know me at all.
          Neither do I, really. I know it sounds cheesy, but I feel like I still don't know who the real me is. And I won't 'til I'm on my own.
        So now I'm studying not just for my parents but for myself as well. I'm going to get a scholarship and move out. Away from them.
        After that, whatever I do, it will be on my own terms. I will live on my own life. Mine. Not the one someone else wants me to live." &#8212 &#171 The Boy and The Beast&#187 </p>
          <p>This was exactly how I felt before I came to the U.S., execpt one thing that my parents and I did fight sometimes. I love my parents but I need space and time to be on my own.
            So, I left home and studied at Northwestern University for one and a half year. This is a life changing decision and I'm grateful that I did it.
          Now, though I couldn't say I found out who the real me is, I know myself better from trying different things and making mistakes.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, I find a career that I believe is right for me.
            My friends always say that I have a good and unique taste of beauty.
            When it comes to career, I make a good use of my taste on designing and developing well crafted user interfaces with pleasing and intuitive user experiences.</p>

          <p>I enjoy speaking with users and doing my best to figure out what they really need.
            I enjoy the process of brainstorming different solutions and testing them with users.
            I also enjoy the state I am in when I put all my efforts to conquer challenges that I meet during implementations.</p>

            <p>Now, I am looking forward to finding a position at a company where I can grow and take on new challenges over time which push me to be better and better.</p>
